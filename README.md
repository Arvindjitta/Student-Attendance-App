# Face Recognition Based Attendance System 

Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies
have made many improvements in the changing world. Smart
Attendance using Real-Time Face Recognition is a real-world
solution which comes with day to day activities of handling
student attendance system. 

Face recognition-based attendance system is a process of recognizing 
the students face for taking attendance by using face biometrics based 
on high - definition picture and other information technology.

In my face recognition project, a computer system will be able to find and
recognize human faces fast and precisely in images that are being captured 
through a mobile camera. We used [python_face_recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) module for recognizing faces,
so that the face of the student can be easily recognized for their 
attendance so that the attendance database can be easily reflected automatically.
